The codes in this repository are released as part of the SophiaBeads Datasets Project, and tailored to be used to process and/or reconstruct the SophiaBeads Datasets. \r\n\r\n\r\n#### Purpose of the Project and the Code\r\nSophiaBeads Datasets are acquired specifically for testing and comparing reconstruction methods for x-ray computed tomography. Our main objective is to provide a framework where reconstruction methods can be implemented and tested with the use of these datasets, where we know what the answer should be. You can find more information on the purpose of these datasets via _this paper_.\r\n\r\nThe datasets are collected using the _Nikon Custom Bay_ X-ray CT machine. The machine employs a cone-beam geometry and requires specific geometrical setup before the datasets can be used. The sophiabeads-datasets code _allows_ the user to interpret and use these datasets in their work. The codes in that sense are essential to use the SophiaBeads Datasets.\r\n\r\n#### Downloading\r\nDownload the GitHub repository as a [tar.gz]() or a [zip]() file at the top of this page.\r\n\r\nVisit the [Zenodo SophiaBeads Datasets](https://zenodo.org/record/16474) page to access and download the datasets. \r\n\r\n#### Repository Contents\r\n* XTek/\r\n  - CBproject.m\r\n  - CBbackproject.m\r\n  - load_nikon.m\r\n* c/\r\n  - CBproject_c.c\r\n  - CBbackproject_c.c\r\n  - project_singledata.c\r\n  - backproject_singledata.c\r\n   - jacobs_rays.h\r\n* mex/\r\n  - CBbackproject_c.mexa64\r\n  - CBbackproject_c.mexmaci64\r\n  - CBbackproject_c.mexw64\r\n  - CBproject_c.mexa64\r\n  - CBproject_c.mexmaci64\r\n  - CBproject_c.mexw64\r\n* tools/\r\n  - centre_geom.m\r\n  - find_centre.m\r\n  - read_vol.m\r\n  - write_tiff.m\r\n  - write_vol.m\r\n- sophiaBeads.m\r\n- setup.m\r\n- pre_recon.m\r\n- cutDown_data.m\r\n- cgls_XTek.m\r\n\r\n#### Documentation\r\nA detailed documentation and tutorials about the codes can be found in _this report_.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Want to Contribute?\r\nWe are not open to external contributions.
